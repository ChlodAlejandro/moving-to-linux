# Emoji Picker
On Windows 10, hitting `Win` + `.` gives you a supercharged character map. This includes more than just emojis, but also symbols, emoticons, and other fun stuff. This just *doesn't* exist on Linux, and it doesn't look like there are *good* alternatives.

## Issues encountered
### Smile
Smile only supports emojis and does not include symbols or emoticons.

It works. I have to set a custom shortcut for it to pop up. It doesn't immediately enter the emoji into the text box I'm typing in, because that apparently needs a [GNOME extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6096/smile-complementary-extension/) and I'm using Cinnamon. It also copies the emoji into my clipboard, which *would* flood my clipboard history manager *if I had one* (which I don't right now, because *there's also no good clipboard history manager*). I can settle for this but better would be nice.
